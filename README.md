# mod map_backward_capability
mod for game 0 A.D.

mod that provides backward compatibility for map objects.

How it works:
In the history of the repository, we find all the renamed files (xml,png,dae,dds) and copy them to a mod directory with the current contents but the old name.
Old maps should display objects instead of errors in the console.

Copy ```path_backward_capability24.zip``` (Release version) or ```path_backward_capability25.zip``` (Developer version)
into directory
```~/.local/share/0ad/mods/MODNAME``` (Unix) or ```C:\Users\{USERNAME}\Documents\My Games\0ad\mods\MODNAME``` (Windows)

Copy your map to ```~/.local/share/0ad/mods/MODNAME/maps/skirmishes``` (```C:\Users\{USERNAME}\Documents\My Games\0ad\mods\MODNAME\maps\skirmishes```)

Enable mod in game.
